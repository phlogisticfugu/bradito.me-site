I've been catching up on the latest developments in Large Language Models (LLMs)
and find visual maps useful when learning.  So I made a 
[data-driven dynamic LLM lineage map](https://phlogisticfugu.github.io/phlogistic-llm-map/)
([source code](https://github.com/phlogisticfugu/phlogistic-llm-map))
to suit my needs:

While I do love to build things, I love to build things that provide useful value more. So I first took a look at
[some](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18223) of the
[existing](https://github.com/Mooler0410/LLMsPracticalGuide)
visualizations that others have done.  The reasons I made my own are:

- Be data-driven.  As more new models come out, or corrections are made I want a visualization that automatically adapts to change.
- Link to the source.  To serve as a map to learning, navigation is essential.
- Visualize data richly.  Multiple properties about each model are shown in the same image.
