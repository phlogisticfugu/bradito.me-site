As in any hype-cycle, there are ideas that originate early, based on little experience with the new technology
that then become repeated, and repeated, so much so that they look like truths.  But really they are fallacies based on incorrect assumptions.

1. You need an NVIDIA device to do Generative AI

hype:
- https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/nvidias-a100-is-the-10000-chip-powering-the-race-for-ai-.html
- https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-buys-tens-thousands-nvidia-202148183.html

companies made on the assumption of needing this:

- https://jarvislabs.ai/
- https://vast.ai/
- https://www.paperspace.com/
- https://www.runpod.io/
- https://www.banana.dev/
- https://www.beam.cloud/
- https://modal.com/
- https://replicate.com/
- https://lambdalabs.com/

will be killed by "inference on the edge":
- ONNX, mac=CoreML or llama.cpp/ggml, Apache TVM
- https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/

2. You need a vector database

3. Langchain is the future
