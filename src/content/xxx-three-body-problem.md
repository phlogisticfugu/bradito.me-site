Generative AI solves previously-difficult problems, including a class of communication problem I am calling the "three body problem"

background:
- in physics, gravity causes everything to pull on each other.  Earth pulls on the moon, but the moon also pulls on the earth
  for two bodies, can model the motion on on paper.  but for three bodies (gif showing this) it gets more complicated, and in practice (as when predicting motion in space, for satellites, for example), people use computers to brute-force predictions of motion

in communication, there are three important parts:
- the speaker
- the content
- the listener


examples:

ecommerce:
- speaker=brand voice
- content=product information
- listener=consumer


digital advertising advertorials:
- speaker=publisher
- content=advertised product or service from advertiser
- listener=audience

education:
- speaker=teacher
- content=lesson
- listener=student

charity fundraising:
- speaker=charity brand voice
- content=charity mission/campaign
- listener=donor / potential donor
